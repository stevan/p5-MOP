# p5-MOP

This is the final prototype for adding a MOP (Meta Object Protocol) to Perl 5. 

... more details to come soon ...

## CONTRIBUTING

We are still in the early stages of this project, but any help would be much 
appreciated. Looking over the tests you will see a number of "TODO" lists at 
the top of files, this is a great way to get started with contributing to this
project. 

## INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES

Every effort has been made to reduce dependencies or to keep them minimal and 
sane. 

However, in the interest of avoiding having to write some C/XS before we are 
ready, we have opted to use some CPAN modules for the time being. The end 
goal is to have no dependencies, but for now just use the following command
to install our current set of dependencies.

```
cpanm --installdeps .
```
