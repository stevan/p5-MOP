Perl 5 MOP
==========

------------------------------------------------------------------

Object Orientation in Perl is just a Design Pattern
---------------------------------------------------

The mechanisms of OO Perl are few and they all operate off of
the assumption that users have followed the agreed upon patterns.

- classes are packages
- methods are subs in a package
- `our @ISA` is used to store inheritance relationship
- `bless` is used to attach a reference (instance) to
   a package (class)
- methods are dispatched using the `->` operator

This proposal aims to add a few more items to the pattern.

- roles are just packages
- role methods are subs that are defined in a package
    - inherited methods are ignored
    - imported subs are ignored
- required (abstract) methods are just pre-declared subs
- `our @DOES` is used to store role relationships
- `our %HAS` is used to store attribute/member/slot
  information

... and not strictly needed, but very nice to have.

- an absract class is a class which has one or more
  required methods
- it is possible to close a class/package, which implies
  a promise of no future alteration will be done

------------------------------------------------------------------

Design Goals
------------

- Do as much as possible at compile time to make things
  easy (and cheap) at runtime
- Strive for internal consistency
    - Perl 5 already has an object system
        - and billions of lines of code using it
    - the mop should provide an API to that system
        - and it should be easy to keep consistent state
          between the two systems
- Accessor generation is a solved problem
    - focus on lower level integration with the language
        - sugar can always be added later on

------------------------------------------------------------------

mop::object
-----------

The construction protocol for mop::object expects that by runtime
you have already "compiled" all the neccessary meta information into
the package. This is because it must be able to read all meta
information using just package stash/glob operations only. (see the
"Design Goals" above)

------------------------------------------------------------------

The role of `bless`
-------------------

The mop intentionally does not do any meta-object management, that
is considered to be the responsibility of the user of the mop.

However, we may decide that is a stupid idea, in which case it will
make sense to support the idea of "pinning" a specific metaclass to
a given package. I believe that it makes more sense to then overide
the built in `bless` operation to support possible dynamic dispatch
to a "pinned" metaclass, rather then force all who want to use this
feature to manage their metaclasses, etc. etc. etc. This could be
turned on and off via some kind of lexical pragma to better facilitate
gradual adoption.

Questions
---------

## Do we actually want to alias required methods?

There is value in knowing that a method was not defined in a package,
meaning that it is not owned by that package. But is there value in
knowing this when it comes to required methods?

Required methods will get composed in from roles, and they will be
inherited from abstract classes, but they are mostly just markers
that something is missing. They can't conflict since their bodies
are always the same (NULL) and when you have two of the same name
it is the same as having one.

## Do we want to check abstract-ness via required methods?

Currently, via the mop::role API, we define abstract-ness with two
different criteria. First, does a class/role have any required
methods? This is the more classic definition of "abstract" in which
the class/role is not complete and therefore cannot be instantiated.
Second, is the class/role explicitly marked as "abstract"? This is
the case where you, the programmer, decided the class was abstract.

By making the "is-abstract" check have to look at the set of required
methods, we slow down all instance construction. If instead we only
looked at the $IS_ABSTRACT flag/package-variable, and relied on the
fact that required methods would be checked at compile time and set
the $IS_ABSTRACT accordingly, then we could speed things up and avoid
a lot of runtime meta layer calls.

IMPLMENTATION NOTES:

We should be already inheriting the required methods, this same process
can also transfer the IS_ABSTRACT flag from package to package.
